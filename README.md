## Summary
The goal of The Perfect Fit is to help users find out various information about an area they are wishing to move to. After searching a city you are given neighborhood pricing data, economic data, Meetup.com data, and weather data.

This project was created with jQuery and utilized many API calls.

## How-to
Upon opening the application you will be greeted with the Home Page. This is the only page of the application. On the Home Page there is a Search form. After inputting information into the Search form and clicking **Search City**, information will appear below. This information is created based on what you have inputted. If you searched for Raleigh, North Carolina with a budget of 200,000 then you receive information relevant to that.

A key feature of the application is the ability to compare two locations. This is done the same way of searching normally, as described above, but instead of clicking the **Search City** button, you click the **Add Second City** button. The information for the 2nd city will appear below the first city information.

## Conclusion
This was the first group project of the Full-Stack Bootcamp and was a good first learning experience of working with others. If given more time to work on the project, as a group we would have liked to reorganize the data in a way that is easier for the user to digest.
